    <p>Suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The code could have better structure. It uses div from the beginning to the end which is very confusing. Things like nav, header and footer could be used to give it a better structure. Besides, all its code is in one file. There is no separate file for Javascript, CSS and so on. This makes it really hard for me to read its orginal code. Different file for styling and javascript could make it more easy to read.</li>
      <li>Have better accesibility. Currently, users cannot use keyboard to navigate through the website. Enable keyboard navigation could help people who have difficulty using mouse. Moreover, it can increase its usability by using landmark to help people who use assistive devices and do not want to browse the content linearly.</li>
      <li>Add alt for images and some alt should be more specific. Currently the website have five images which do not have alt text. For those that have alt text, the text is very simple. For example, there is text on the the website's one picture, but the text is not read by voiceover and the alt text is very brief which cannot fully illustrate the meaning of this picture.</li>
      <li>Add media queries to make the website responsive for different screen sizes. For now, if I make the web browser smaller, the website would not change and thus would only show part of it. Using media query could make it more responsive. In addition, making pictures responsive by setting their sizes correspond with screen size could also help.</li>
